                <p>Ever since Taylor dropped her first album I have been a fan. I think shes a great person, she's just a normal human being that made it. Her music always seems to explain my feelings so well &amp; no one else can do it like she can.</p><br>

                <p>Sailor Moon has been a love of mine since I was a child. I've never stopped loving it. This is a show that has taught me so much. It's shown me the importance of friendship,self love,kindness, and so much more.It'really shaped me into the person I am today and I am very grateful</p><br>

                <p>My love for Poke`mon all started with Poke`mon yellow. I have purchased every single poke`mon game that Nintendo has released over and over again. The games aren't really different in any way and I'm still buying them and I don't know why. I guess I love them too much.</p></article>
